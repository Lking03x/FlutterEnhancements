# FlutterEnhancements
Basic Flutter support for Sublime Text 3.

## Features
- Hot reload on save
- Build, run and some other helpful commands

## Limitations
- Only works on POSIX platforms, which also has `bash` installed... This means that Windows isn't supported.

## TODO
Nothing really. But if you have a suggestion then just make an issue, I will take a look at it.
